          <h1>Case Study: Rethinking the Dropdown Menu</h1>
          <p class="name">Sarah Ridley ● Brown University ● February 2025</p>
          <p>
            In this case study, I examined one UI component and considered
            alternative designs that could increase the component's
            accesibility, potentially at the risk of learnability, memorability,
            or efficiency. The UI component I chose is the dropdown component. I
            explored the accessibility of this component across devices and
            across modes of interacting with the device. In the sections below,
            I walk through the process I took in approaching this accessible
            redesign.
          </p>
          <h2 id="input">I: Input</h2>
          <p>
            This case study focuses on the dropdown menu UI component. I
            examined three different applications with dropdown menus, including
            the EdStem website, the Appple Calendar web/mobile
            application, and the Starbucks website/mobile app. For
            context, EdStem is a message board platform that facilitates
            student, TA, and professor interactions, that is commonly used at
            Brown. I first explored how different modes of input, including the
            mouse/touchpad, keyboard, and touch (on mobile) enabled different
            interactions with the dropdown menus in these three applications.

          <h3>EdStem Web App</h3>
          <img
            src="public/edstem-screenshots.svg"
            alt="Compiled screenshots of my interactions with the filter dropdown menu on EdStem"
            class="pad"
            width="80%"
          />
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th style="width:10%"><b>Mouse/ Touchpad</b></th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The top screenshots show EdStem's dropdown menu for
                    filtering discussion posts on the desktop website.
                    When I hover over the filter button with my mouse, the button turns from gray to blue.
                    Once I click on the button, the dropdown menu appears below
                    the filter button. If I move my mouse away, the dropdown menu stays visible, but when I click
                    anywhere other than the dropdown menu, it disappears.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If instead I hover over an option while the dropdown menu
                    is open, the option turns blue.
                    Then, if I click one of the options,
                    the menu disappears and updates the filter.
                    However, with my mouse, I cannot select the text in
                    any of the options, nor copy
                    and paste this text elsewhere.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One learnable aspect of using the dropdown with my mouse 
                    is that the menu button has a down arrow
                    on it. This is learnable because for first-time users, 
                    the down arrow is a good affordance to try clicking
                    to cause options to appear below. Something
                    efficient is that the order of the dropdown options never changes, so users can grow a
                    muscle-memory about where to click if they
                    frequently need to filter messages.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Considering mouse interactions, one feature that
                    stood out about EdStem's filter dropdown menu was
                    that the dropdown button turns blue on hover, whereas neither
                    Apple Calendar or Starbucks components change color on hover. This
                    makes it easier for a mouse user to see that they
                    are in range to click the dropdown menu button they want to press, in case
                    they have difficulty discerning which components are buttons.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </td>
            <tr>
              <th><b>Keyboard</b></th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To use the dropdown with the keyboard only, I had to
                    press the tab key until the filter dropdown button was
                    selected. Once selected, I then had to press
                    the return key, which opened the dropdown menu. Then, I
                    could use the up and down arrows to change which option was
                    highlighted. When I pressed return, the highlighted
                    option was inputted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    With my keyboard, I found that I can't select the text in
                    the dropdown menu. I tried to use the Command + A shortcut, 
                    but it selected all the other text on the page
                    except the text in the dropdown menu. Something that I could
                    do with my keyboard was close the dropdown menu without
                    selecting anything with the escape key.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I found it memorable and efficient to use the up and down arrows to
                    navigate once the dropdown is open. However, 
                    this impedes learnability, since users need to use the tab key to focus on the dropdown button, but then
                    the up and down keys inside the
                    dropdown. To me, this would me easier to learn if users always
                    used the tab key to switch between components and to switch between different options.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Compared to Apple Calendar and Starbucks, I found that
                    EdStem did better in terms of accessibility. As described
                    below, both Apple Calendar and Starbucks were more difficult to use with a keyboard, which is often
                    how people with physical disabilities interact with
                    websites.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th><b>Touch (Mobile)</b></th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The bottom screenshots above show my interactions with the
                    filter dropdown menu on the EdStem website from a mobile
                    device. On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the
                    bottom of my screen, and covers the entire screen. From
                    there, I can click on of the filters, which closes the
                    dropdown, or click "Cancel", which closes the dropdown without
                    filtering.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As with the mouse and keyboard, I cannot highlight the
                    text in the dropdown on my phone. When I try to press and
                    hold on the text, nothing happens. However, one functionality this component does have is
                    scrolling. If there are too many filter options
                    to fit the screen height, I can scroll to see more options
                    below.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Something efficient about this dropdown is that
                    experienced users can memorize the positions of two quick taps if
                    they filter posts on EdStem frequently. However, it is not learnable
                    that the open dropdown menu fills the entire screen. This means
                    that new users who accidentally tap the dropdown button will have no idea what they
                    accidentally pressed since the screen is now filled.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    From a different perspective, this fullscreen dropdown makes the EdStem mobile dropdown more
                    accessible in some ways than the Apple Calendar or
                    Starbucks. Filling the entire screen does make each option
                    bigger, which is more accessible to people who struggle with
                    fine motor controls.

                <td><ul>
              <li>
                The left screenshots show Apple Calendar's dropdown menu for
                choosing an event's calendar on the desktop web
                application. When I hover with my mouse
                over the button that opens the dropdown, it does
                not change. Once I click on the button, the dropdown menu
                appears over the button. If I move my mouse on the
                screen, the dropdown menu stays visible, but when I click anywhere
                other than the menu, it disappears.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the dropdown menu is visible, if I hover over the options,
                each option turns pink. This pink is a Mac system setting that users
                customize. Then, if I click one of the
                options in the dropdown menu, the menu disappears and updates
                the selected calendar. With my mouse, I cannot select
                the text in any of the options in the dropdown menu nor copy and paste this text to somewhere else.
              </li>
              <li>
                One gap in learnability is that the dropdown menu has an up
                arrow and a down arrow on the button. I don't
                think this is learnable because for a dropdown, I would
                expect just a down arrow. There is also no text on this button
                that says anything about choosing a calendar. However, this is
                efficient from a space perspective, and as users get
                experienced with Apple Calendar, they already know what the
                button does.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compared to EdStem and Starbucks, something accesible about Apple
                Calendar dropdown menu is that the text
                color changes when I hover on one of the dropdown option. This
                is because the background color changes to pink, so the text
                changes to white to ensure contrast for those with visual
                impairments.
              </li>
            </ul></td>

            <tr>
                <th>Keyboard</th>
                <td><ul>
              <li>
                Using only the keyboard to navigate this dropdown menu on Apple
                Calendar was virtually impossible. With a calendar event open,
                as I tabbed through the options on the editing window, the dropdown menu
                button was never focused. As I later learned, it only tabbed into focus 
                with VoiceOver activated. After using my mouse to open the dropdown, I was
                able to use the up and down keys to switch between
                options.
              </li>
              <li>
                Like the EdStem dropdown, I couldn't select the text in
                the dropdown menu. When I pressed Command + A with the
                dropdown open, nothing happened. When I pressed Command C, it
                closed the dropdown menu. Then, I pasted in a text file to see
                if it had copied anything, and it pastd all the information
                about the calendar event except the dropdown calendar
                options.
              </li>
              <li>
                I found it frustrating that I couldn't navigate into the
                calendar dropdown with my keyboard only. This component isn't 
                learnable, memorable, nor efficient if it can't be used at all.
              </li>
              <li>
                This component not being navigable with the keyboard
                is also inherently inaccessible. This is a mismatch, since the dropdown
                can only be used with a mouse or VoiceOver. Those who rely on their
                keyboard due to physical
                impairments therefore likely struggle to change the calendar
                that their events are assigned to.

                <td><ul>
              <li>
                The right screenshots above show my interactions with the
                calendar dropdown menu on the mobile Apple Calendar app. 
                On my phone, the dropdown menu pulls up and covers the
                right half of my screen. I can scroll when the options overflow,
                click to the left to leave the dropdown, or select an
                options.
              </li>
              <li>
                As on desktop, I cannot highlight the text in the dropdown on my phone.
                When I try to press and hold on the text, nothing happens, and
                when I release, the dropdown menu select whichever calendar
                whose text I was trying to highlight. Similarly, this component does not 
                support multiple selections, so I can only assign an event to one calendar.
              </li>
              <li>
                On mobile, the dropdown is more learnable than desktop in the sense that 
                on mobile, the name of the current calendar is on the dropdown menu
                button. This makes it more
                learnable and memorable because someone using the app for the
                first time, or the first time in a while, will more quickly
                understand that the dropdown will let them select a different
                calendar for this event.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compared to EdStem and Starbucks, something
                that makes the Apple Calendars mobile dropdown less accessible is
                that does not fill the screen by default. This
                makes it easier to accidentally click out of the Apple Calendars dropdown. For
                the EdStem and Starbucks mobile dropdowns, you can only close
                them (without making a selection) with an explicit "Cancel" or "X" button.

                The left screenshots show my interactions with the dropdown 
                for choosing a milk when ordering on Starbucks' website. 
                When I hover with my mouse over the
                button that opens the dropdown, the button does not change. When 
                I click it, it turns green and the dropdown
                menu opens over it. If I move my mouse on
                the screen, the menu stays visible, but when I click
                anywhere other than the dropdown menu, it closes.
              </li>
              <li>
                With the dropdown menu open, if I hover over the milk options,
                each option turns pink. Like with the calendar app, this pink is
                a customizable Mac system setting. If I click one of the options
                in the dropdown menu, the menu disappears and updates the
                selected milk. This menu appears to use
                Apple's built-in dropdown, so naturally it functions very similarly
                to the Apple Calendar dropdowns.
              </li>
              <li>
                The text above the dropdown menu says "Milk", and there is
                a down arrow on the button, which both enhance learnabilty. Specifically, the arrow
                is a clear affordance for where to click. Something that
                could enhance efficiency would be adding a "Favorites" section at the top of
                the dropdown where they could save their preferred milk for easy clicking, 
                since repeat customers often have strong milk preferences.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regarding accessibility, unlike EdStem, hovering over Starbucks'
                dropdown menu button does not change its color. Changing colors 
                on hover would enhance accessibility,
                since the color signals to mouse users with motor control impairment that they are
                in the right area to click.

              <li>
                With my keyboard, I used the tab
                key to focus on the dropdown button, but when I
                pressed the return key, the menu
                did not open. I later learned that with VoiceOver on, I could use the 
                keys Control + Option + Space to open the menu. However, this 
                combination does not work when VoiceOver is off. When I
                use my mouse to open the dropdown, I could use
                the up and down keys to navigate the options.
              </li>
              <li>
                Like the EdStem and Apple Calendar dropdowns, I couldn't select
                the text in the dropdown. I tried Command + A, but this closed
                the dropdown menu and highlighted all the other text on the
                page. Also, nothing happened when I tried to drag and drop the
                text from the dropdown elsewhere, except for closing the
                dropdown.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similar to Apple Calendar, I was disappointed that I failed to
                navigate into the milk dropdown with my keyboard. Again, this
                impedes the learnability, memorability, and efficiency of this
                feature.
              </li>
              <li>
                This lack of keyboard navigability is also an accessibility 
                flaw, given that users with
                physical disabilities are the most likley to use a
                keyboard to navigate their screen. These
                dropdowns that are completely unusable without a mouse or VoiceOver create a
                mismatch that increases the difficulty of using this site.

                The right screenshots above show my interactions with the
                calendar dropdown menu on the mobile Starbucks app. 
                On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the bottom
                and covers almost the entire screen. I can scroll when the
                options overflow, click to the X to leave the dropdown, or
                select a milk option.
              </li>
              <li>
                An interesting functionality of dropdown is
                that I can minimize the dropdown menu by dragging the top
                halfway down my screen. Now, the menu only takes up the bottom
                half, as shown in my screenshots. Like the other mobile
                applications, I cannot highlight the text in the dropdown.
              </li>
              <li>
                I appreciate that the Starbucks website and mobile app have very similar
                dropdown designs. This makes the platforms more efficient for users
                who switch between the website and the mobile app. This
                also makes one more learnable for those who have already used
                the other.

                Compared to the EdStem and Apple Calendar,
                an accessibility flaw with the Starbucks' mobile dropdown
                is the similarity in motions to scroll and exit. While there is a small "X" button, 
                the more intuitive option for many users
                is to swipe down to close the menu. However,
                the swiping motion also scrolls in the dropdown. Different functionalities
                that require the same input limits accessibility for
                users with impaired motor control.

            After exploring inputs, I also explored outputs from the dropdown

            to the user. So, I explored outputs including colors, text label,

                  On the EdStem website on Mac, the button to open the filter
                  dropdown menu turns blue on hover. This output sends the
                  signal to the user that this 'Filter' text is actually a
                  clickable button. On both Mac and mobible, when clicked, the
                  button becomes a deeper blue, signalling to the user that they
                  have successfully clicked the button and can now choose an
                  option. Similarly, when hovering over each of the dropdown
                  options, they turn blue, signalling to the user again that
                  they can click one of these options. Finally, once they select
                  a filter from the dropdown, the filter button stays a deep
                  blue, even after being de-selected, to represent that the
                  selected filter has been applied.

                  When I hover over the calendar dropdown menu in Apple
                  Calendar, the color of the dropdown button does not change.
                  Once I select the dropdown menu, the button goes out of sight
                  on both Mac and mobile. However, one way that this component
                  does use color is that each calendar is assigned a color, and
                  the button's color changes to the color of the calendar
                  selected on both Mac and mobile. This color output can help
                  efficiency, because common users know what color calendar they
                  are looking for without needing to read the text in the
                  dropdown menu.

                  change. However, when I click on the dropdown menu button, on
                  Mac and mobile, the button turns green. While visually
                  appealing, I don't find this color output particularly useful,
                  since when you click the button, the dropdown menu also
                  appears, so you already know you've clicked the button. I
                  would find this green color more useful if it appeared on
                  hover, to signal that your mouse is in the right place to open
                  the menu.

                  is labeled with the text 'Filter' and a downward arrow.
                  However, after the user selects a filter from the dropdown,
                  the text label changes from 'Filter' to the name of the filter
                  applied, such as 'Unread', as in my screenshots. This is a
                  valuable piece of output for the user, because it reinforces

                  On Mac, there is no text label on the calendar dropdown
                  button, only the color of the calendar and the up and down
                  arrows. On mobile, the button does have text, and it is the
                  name of the calendar currently selected for the event. When
                  the selected calendar changes, the button's text changes to
                  reflect the new event selected. This text is a valuable piece
                  of output, since it verifies to users that they selected the
                  correct calendar.

                  At the top of the dropdown menu button, in smaller font than
                  the label in the middle of the button, is “Milk”, to signal to
                  users that this dropdown selects their milk option. Before the
                  user selects a milk, the default milk is 2%, so the button is
                  initially labeled with “2% Milk”. When the user selects a
                  different milk, the text label changes to display the name of
                  the new milk. I find this output useful, but I disagree with
                  having a default milk option. Instead, I think the selection
                  should start as something like “Not Selected”, and the user
                  shouldn't be able to buy the drink without selecting a milk.
                  An error message output would prevent people from skipping
                  over this dropdown and ending up with milk that they don't
                  like or cannot drink.

                  Using the tab key, I can focus on different components along

                  I can use the return key to open the dropdown menu. Once I
                  have done so, then I have to use the up and down arrows to
                  switch between options, and the tab key does nothing. I don't
                  think needing to switch from the tab key to the arrow keys
                  would make sense to someone unable to see the screen. I think
                  there is no problem with the up and down keys working here,

                  specific event. However, when I use the tab key inside this
                  editing window, the dropdown menu is never focused on. Not
                  being able to focus on the dropdown menu of course impedes the
                  users providing inputs, but it also blocks the outputs that
                  users can get from this application. If they cannot focus on
                  the dropdown menu, then visually impaired users may not know
                  it exists.

                  In the input section above, I explained that I could focus on
                  this dropdown using the tab key, but when I pressed enter, I
                  was unable to open the dropdown menu. This prevents an
                  important output signal, which is that the user has selected
                  the right component to open the dropdown menu. Since the
                  return key does nothing, the user might be confused and think
                  that they have focused on the wrong component in their effort
                  to customize their milk selection. In reality, the application
                  has just mismatched user needs.

                  On my Mac, I used voice over to explore the different verbal
                  descriptions from different states of the EdStem website. When
                  I first navigate to the 'Filter'' button that opens the
                  dropdown and focus on it, the text that VoiceOver reads out is
                  "Filter, mean pop up collapsed, button, Thread list, region".
                  This tells the user the name of the button, that the button
                  brings up a menu that is currently collapsed, and that it is
                  selectable. When I opened the dropdown menu, the text that
                  VoiceOver read out was "menu, ..." followed by each of the
                  dropdown options. However, as I used the up and down keys to
                  move through options, VoiceOver did not read out their labels.
                  It only read out these labels and called each a "menu item"
                  when I hovered over the options with my mouse.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Surprisingly, when I turned VoiceOver on, I was suddenly able
                  to use the tab key to get to the calendar dropdown menu. I
                  turned VoiceOver off again just to confirm that I still wasn't
                  able to get there without it. I find it confusing that the tab
                  key works differently when one screen reader, VoiceOver, is
                  on. Not all visually impaired users may use VoiceOver as their
                  screen reader, and they should still be able to use this
                  button. Regardless, when I had the button focused with
                  VoiceOver, it read “Calendar, popover, sarah_ridley@brown.edu,
                  pop up button”, where “sarah_ridley@brown.edu” was the name of
                  the current calendar selected. However, I don't think that
                  “popover” is the clearest way to signal that this button opens
                  a dropdown menu. Once the menu was open, it read out the names
                  of each option, and then specified that each was a “menu
                  item”. This makes sense to me, and I think it would be more
                  useful as output if VoiceOver specified that the button opened
                  this menu of items.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Just as with Apple Calendar, turning on VoiceOver changed my
                  keyboard interaction options. Now, when I focused on the milk
                  dropdown button with VoiceOver on, it read “2% Milk, Milk,
                  menu pop up collapsed, button”. Compared to the Apple Calendar
                  VoiceOver output, I found the explanation that this was a
                  collapsed pop up menu much clearer than just “popover”. Then,
                  VoiceOver instructed me to press Control + Option + Space to
                  open the menu. Since this allowed me to open the menu, I
                  turned VoiceOver off, and tried this keystroke again with the
                  button focused. This still did not work, so I still have not
                  figured out how to open the dropdown menu with just my
                  keyboard and without VoiceOver. While I think this poses an
                  accessibility problem, I do feel that VoiceOver gave valuable
                  outputs instructing me how to use the button and what it did,
                  which is important for visually impaired users.

          <h2 id="redesign">III: State Models & Component Redesign</h2>
          <p>
            After exploring input and output from EdStem, Apple Calendar, and
            Starbucks, I had several ideas about how to improve the dropdown
            components found in all three applications. However, this case study
            will focus on my redesign of the calendar dropdown menu in Apple
            Calendar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before beginning my redesign, I created state models to display the
            current interactions possible with Apple Calendar's calendar
            dropdown menu. State models show both the available states of the
            component, as well as the actions that transition between states.
            Below, the two state models displaying pre-revision interactions
            with the touchpad and with the keyboard respectively. Note that I
            often refer to pink highlights or borders, this is a Mac system
            setting that users customize.
          </p>
          <h3>Initial Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Mouse User</h3>
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="public/initial-calendar-model-mouse.svg"
              alt="State model for pre-revision mouse interactions with calendar dropdown menu on Apple Calendar"
              width="60%"
            />
            <p class="left-pad">
              Given that this is the state model for mouse interactions, the
              user's mouse position and clicks cause all transitions between
              states. Another important note is that "Open" means that the
              dropdown menu has appeared. As shown in the state model, the
              dropdown menu stays visible even when the mouse leaves the area,
              but disappears if the mouse clicks outside of the dropdown menu
              area.

              <p class="right-pad">
                As described in the input and output sections, without
                VoiceOver, I was unable to focus on the dropdown menu button
                with only my keyboard on my Mac. Therefore, this state model is
                missing a transition from inactive to focus, although it should
                be noted that the button can be tabbed into focus when VoiceOver
                is active.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the calendar dropdown menu button is focused, then I am
                able to use the return key, up and down arrows, and escape key
                to transition between states, as shown.

          <p class="top-pad">
            To follow these initial state models, below I present two new state
            models for my revised calendar dropdown menu component, with mouse
            and with keyboard. The main design change I made includes adding a
            "Confirm" button to the dropdown meu. This choice will be further
            explored and justified in the Figma models presented below.
          </p>
          <h3>Revised Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Mouse User</h3>
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="public/revised-calendar-model-mouse.svg"
              alt="State model for pre-revision keyboard interactions with calendar dropdown menu on Apple Calendar"
              width="70%"
            />
            <p class="left-pad">
              As mentioned, the main revision I made was introducing a "Confirm"
              button on the dropdown menu. So, after a user clicks one of the
              dropdown options, they also need to click the "Confirm" button to
              actually select their chosen option and close the dropdown menu.
              If they do not select "Confirm" after clicking an option, and
              instead click way, their selection will not be submitted.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Revised Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Keyboard User</h3>
          <div class="image-box">
            <div class="right-pad">
              <p>
                Most importantly, I added a transition from disabled to focused
                with the tab key, which the initial state model lacked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to the revised mouse version, the main change to this
                state model is introducing a "Confirm" button. Once the user has
                focused on an option with the up and down keys, when they press
                return, now their focused option is selected. This also
                automatically focuses on the "Confirm" button. Now, the user
                needs to press the return key again to activate the "Confirm"
                button and submit their selection.
              </p>

              width="70%"
            />
          </div>
          <h3>Figma Models</h3>
          <iframe
            style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"

          <p>
            The above Figma model is my redesign of the dropdown menu to assign
            an event to a particular calendar in Apple Calendar. This is the
            button with the blue square and the up/down arrows on the calendar
            event editing window. The model contains three frames, described
            below:
          </p>
          <div class="col-box">
            <ul class="col-box-item">
              <li>
                The first Figma frame displays the initial state of my revised
                calendar dropdown menu. This is the state before the user has
                interacted with the dropdown, so the button is visible but the
                dropdown menu window has not appeared.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="col-box-item">
              <li>
                When the user opens the dropdown menu and hovers over or focuses
                on one of the options, they will see the second frame. So, the
                dropdown menu is open and one of the options is highlighted.
                However, the user has not clicked on their selection yet. After
                clicking on their selection, they will still need to confirm it
                with the "Confirm" button, discussed in the revised state
                models.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="col-box-item">
              <li>
                This is a third, bonus state that I believe is important to
                understanding my redesign. After the user clicks on (or presses
                return on) an option, that option is not yet submitted. Instead,
                the user still must press the Confirm button in the dropdown
                menu to submit their selection and close the dropdown menu.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            My revised component increases accessibility at the expense of
            efficiency. Adding a "Confirm" button means that frequent users have
            one more click or key to press before they can submit their
            selection from the dropdown menu. However, this increases
            accessibility beacuse it means that users with fine motor control
            issues will cannot accidentally submit their selection with one
            click of the mouse or key press. Adding an extra confirmation
            transition means that these users can accidentally select an option,
            but change their selection without the window closing (which is the
            currenet behavior of the component when any option is clicked).
          </p>
          <p>
            This change also improves learnability and memorability in the sense
            that it lets users know that the things that have popped up on
            screen are all options to click, as implied by the "Confirm" button.
            They can play around with clicking these options without the window
            closing every time, and these lower stakes help users get
            comfortable with the component faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other ways, my redesign increases accessibility, without risking
            other properties. For example, since I found that I could not focus
            on the calendar dropdown menu outside of VoiceOver, in my redesign,
            I specified that the tab key could be used to focus on the button.
            This does not reduce learnability, memorability, nor efficiency, it
            only increases accessibility.

          <h2 id="reflection">IV: Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            When exploring the usability of the dropdown menus in EdStem, Apple
            Calendar, and Starbucks, all three applications had interesting uses
            of colors to reflect state back to the user. This guided me to use
            colors that send signals to users about the state of the component
            in my redesign, specifically designing how the hovered option is
            highlighted in different colors than the selected option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comparing the accessibility of these three applications, the most
            accessible component was EdStem's dropdown menu, since it was the
            only one that I could fully navigate with the keyboard without
            turning on VoiceOver. So, keyboard navigability was an acessibility
            consideration missing from Apple Calendar and Starbucks, and in my
            revised Apple Calendar dropdown state model, I specified that the
            dropdown could be opened with the keyboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            When thinking about making components more accessible, it's useful
            to think through the lens of mismatches, or situations where an
            interface creates unnecessary barriers for certain users due to a
            lack of inclusive thinking. In my redesign, adding keyboard
            navigability addresses the mismatch where users that only use the
            keyboard can still interact with this component. Similarly, adding
            the "Confirm" button addresses the mismatch where some users may
            accidentally press or interact with these components, and the
            confirmation step is more forgiving of accidental clicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this sense, the lack of keyboard accessibility on the Apple
            Calendar and Starbucks dropdowns negatively impacting those with
            visual impairments, since focusing on the dropdown was impossible
            without VoiceOver, which not all impaired users might use. On the
            other hand, ARIA text read by VoiceOver is very beneficial to those
            with visual impairments, and I found that of the three applications,
            Starbucks' components had the most clear and descriptive ARIA text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking more generally, it seems that the mouse is the most often
            prioritized when designing components, as many designers are fully
            abled, but this means that they may forget to consider and design
            for the experiences of those who are impaired.
