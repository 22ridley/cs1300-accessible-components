          <h1>Case Study: Rethinking the Dropdown Menu</h1>
          <p class="name">Sarah Ridley ● Brown University ● February 2025</p>
          <p>
            In this case study, I examined one UI component and considered
            an alternative design that could increase the component's
            accesibility, potentially at the risk of learnability, memorability,
            or efficiency. The UI component I chose is the dropdown menu. I
            explored the accessibility of this component across devices and
            across modes of interacting with the device.
          </p>
          <h2 id="input">I: Input</h2>
          <p>
            I began by examining three applications with dropdown menus, including
            the EdStem website, the Appple Calendar web/mobile
            app, and the Starbucks website/mobile app. For
            context, EdStem is a message board platform that facilitates
            student, TA, and professor interactions in use at
            Brown University. I first explored how different modes of input, including the
            mouse/touchpad, keyboard, and touch (on mobile) enabled different
            interactions with a dropdown menus in these three applications.
          </p>
          <h3>EdStem Web App</h3>
          <img
            src="public/edstem-screenshots.svg"
            alt="Compiled screenshots of my interactions with the filter dropdown menu on EdStem"
            class="pad"
            width="80%"
          />
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th style="width:10%"><b>Mouse/ Touchpad</b></th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The top screenshots show EdStem's dropdown menu for
                    filtering discussion posts on the desktop website.
                    When I hover over the "Filter" button with my mouse, the button turns from gray to blue.
                    Once I click on the button, the dropdown menu appears below
                    the "Filter" button. If I move my mouse away, the dropdown menu stays visible, but when I click
                    anywhere other than the dropdown menu, it disappears.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If instead I click one of the options,
                    the menu disappears and updates the filter.
                    However, with my mouse, I cannot select the text in
                    any of the options, nor copy
                    and paste this text elsewhere.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One learnable aspect of using the dropdown with my mouse 
                    is that the menu button has a down arrow
                    on it. This is learnable because for first-time users, 
                    the down arrow is an affordance to click and
                    cause options to appear below. Something
                    efficient is that the order of the dropdown options never changes, so users can grow a
                    muscle-memory about where to click if they
                    frequently need to filter messages.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Considering mouse interactions, one feature that
                    stood out about EdStem's dropdown menu was
                    that the button turns blue on hover, whereas neither
                    Apple Calendar or Starbucks components change color on hover. This
                    makes it easier for a mouse user to see that they
                    are in range to click the dropdown menu button they want to press, in case
                    they have difficulty discerning which components are buttons.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </td>
            <tr>
              <th><b>Keyboard</b></th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To use the dropdown with the keyboard only, I had to
                    press the tab key until the "Filter" dropdown button was
                    focused. Once focused, I used
                    the return key to open the menu. Then, I
                    could use the up and down arrows to change which option was
                    focused. When I pressed return, the focused
                    option was inputted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    With my keyboard, I found that I can't select the text in
                    the dropdown menu. I tried Command + A, 
                    but it selected all the other text on the page
                    except the text in the dropdown menu. Something that I could
                    do with my keyboard was close the dropdown menu without
                    selecting anything with the escape key.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Somthing that impedes learnability is that users need to 
                    use the tab key to focus on the dropdown button, but then
                    the up and down keys inside the
                    dropdown. It would be more learnable if users
                    used the tab key to both switch between components and between different options inside a component.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Compared to Apple Calendar and Starbucks, I found that
                    EdStem did better in terms of accessibility. As described
                    below, both Apple Calendar and Starbucks were more difficult to use with a keyboard, which is often
                    how people with physical disabilities interact with
                    websites.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th><b>Touch (Mobile)</b></th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The bottom screenshots above show my interactions with the
                    "Filter" dropdown menu on the EdStem website from a mobile
                    device. On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the
                    bottom of my screen, and covers the entire screen. From
                    there, I can click on a filter, which closes the
                    dropdown and applies the filter, or click "Cancel", which closes the dropdown without
                    filtering.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As with the mouse and keyboard, I cannot highlight the
                    text in the dropdown on my phone. When I try to press and
                    hold on the text, nothing happens. However, one functionality this component does have is
                    scrolling. If there are too many filter options
                    to fit the screen height, I can scroll to see more options
                    below.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Something efficient about this dropdown is that
                    experienced users can memorize the positions of two quick taps if
                    they filter posts on EdStem frequently. However, it is not learnable
                    that the open dropdown menu fills the entire screen. This means
                    that new users who accidentally tap the dropdown button will have no idea what they
                    accidentally pressed since the screen is now filled.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    From a different perspective, this fullscreen dropdown makes the EdStem mobile dropdown more
                    accessible in some ways than the Apple Calendar or
                    Starbucks. Filling the entire screen makes each option
                    bigger, which is more accessible to people whose motor controls are impaired.

              <li>
                The left screenshots show Apple Calendar's dropdown menu for
                choosing an event's calendar on the desktop
                application. When I hover with my mouse
                over the dropdown button, it does
                not change. Once I click the button, the menu
                appears over the button. If I move my mouse on the
                screen, the dropdown menu stays visible, but when I click anywhere
                other than the menu, it disappears.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the dropdown menu is visible, if I click one of the
                options, the menu disappears and updates
                the selected calendar. With my mouse, I cannot select
                the text in any of the options in the dropdown menu nor copy and paste this text to somewhere else.
              </li>
              <li>
                One gap in learnability is that the dropdown menu has an up
                and a down arrow on the button. Instead, many users would
                expect only a down arrow. There is also no text on this button
                to suggest its functionality. However, this is
                efficient from a space perspective, as
                experienced users already know what it does.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compared to EdStem, something accesible about the Apple
                Calendar dropdown menu is that the text
                color changes when I hover on one of the dropdown option. This
                is because the background color changes to pink, so the text
                changes to white to ensure contrast for those with visual
                impairments.
              </li>
            </ul></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Keyboard</th>
                <td><ul>
              <li>
                Using only the keyboard to navigate this dropdown menu on Apple
                Calendar was virtually impossible. With a calendar event open,
                as I tabbed through the options on the editing window, the dropdown menu
                button was never focused. As I later learned, it only tabbed into focus 
                with VoiceOver on. After using my mouse to open the dropdown, I was
                able to use the up and down keys to switch between
                options.
              </li>
              <li>
                Like the EdStem dropdown, I couldn't select the text in
                the dropdown menu. When I pressed Command + A with the
                dropdown open, nothing happened. When I pressed Command + C, it
                closed the dropdown menu. Then, I pasted into a text file to see
                if it had copied anything, and it pastd all the information
                about the calendar event except the dropdown calendar
                options.
              </li>
              <li>
                I found it frustrating that I couldn't navigate into the
                calendar dropdown with my keyboard only. This component isn't 
                learnable, memorable, nor efficient if it can't be used at all by some users.
              </li>
              <li>
                This component not being navigable with the keyboard
                is also inherently inaccessible. This is a mismatch, since the dropdown
                can only be used with a mouse or VoiceOver. Those who rely on their
                keyboard due to physical
                impairments therefore likely struggle to change the calendar
                that their events are assigned to.
              </li>
            </ul></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Touch (Mobile)</th>
                <td><ul>
              <li>
                The right screenshots above show my interactions with the
                calendar dropdown menu on the mobile Apple Calendar app. 
                On my phone, the dropdown menu pulls up and covers the
                right half of my screen. I can scroll when the options overflow,
                click to the left to leave the dropdown, or select a calendar option.
              </li>
              <li>
                As on desktop, I cannot highlight the text in the dropdown on my phone.
                When I try to press and hold on the text, nothing happens. 
                This component also does not 
                support multiple selections, so I can only assign an event to one calendar.
              </li>
              <li>
                This dropdown is more learnable than on desktop because 
                the name of the current calendar is on the mobile dropdown menu
                button. This is more
                learnable and memorable because the text helps new users to more quickly
                understand that the dropdown will let them select a different
                calendar for this event.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compared to EdStem and Starbucks, something
                that makes the Apple Calendar mobile dropdown less accessible is
                that does not fill the screen by default. This
                makes it easier to accidentally click out of the Apple Calendar dropdown. For
                the EdStem and Starbucks mobile dropdowns, you can only close
                them (without making a selection) with an explicit "Cancel" or "X" button. 
              </li>

                The left screenshots show my interactions with the dropdown 
                for choosing a milk when ordering on Starbucks' website. 
                When I hover with my mouse over the dropdown
                button, it does not change. When 
                I click it, it turns green and the dropdown
                menu opens over it. If I move my mouse on
                the screen, the menu stays visible, but when I click
                anywhere other than the dropdown menu, it closes.
              </li>
              <li>
                With the dropdown menu open, if I click one of the options, 
                the menu disappears and updates the
                selected milk. One interaction that is not possible is selecting
                multiple kinds of milk, as only one option can be chosen.
              </li>
              <li>
                The text above the dropdown says "Milk", and there is
                a down arrow on the button, which both enhance learnabilty. Specifically, the arrow
                is a clear affordance for where to click. Something that
                could improve efficiency would be adding a "Favorites" section at the top of
                the dropdown where users could save their preferred milk for easy clicking, 
                since repeat customers often have strong milk preferences.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regarding accessibility, unlike EdStem, hovering over Starbucks'
                dropdown menu button does not change its color. Changing colors 
                on hover would enhance accessibility,
                since the color signals to mouse users with motor control impairment that they are
                in the right area to click.

                key to focus on the dropdown button, but when I
                pressed the return key, the menu
                did not open. I later learned that with VoiceOver on, I could use the 
                keys Control + Option + Space to open the menu. However, this 
                combination does not work when VoiceOver is off. When I
                use my mouse to open the dropdown, I can use
                the up and down keys to navigate the options.
              </li>
              <li>
                Like the EdStem and Apple Calendar dropdowns, I couldn't select
                the text in the Starbucks dropdown. I tried Command + A, but this closed
                the dropdown menu and highlighted all the other text on the
                page. Also, nothing happened when I tried to drag and drop the
                text from the dropdown elsewhere, except for closing the
                dropdown.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similar to Apple Calendar, I was disappointed that I failed to
                navigate into the milk dropdown with my keyboard. Again, this
                impedes the learnability, memorability, and efficiency of this
                feature.
              </li>
              <li>
                This lack of keyboard navigability is also an accessibility 
                flaw, given that users with
                physical disabilities are the most likley to use a
                keyboard to navigate their screen. These
                dropdowns that are completely unusable without a mouse or VoiceOver create a
                mismatch that increases the difficulty of using this site.

                The right screenshots above show my interactions with the
                calendar dropdown menu on the mobile Starbucks app. 
                On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the bottom
                and covers almost the entire screen. I can scroll when the
                options overflow, click to the X to leave the dropdown, or
                select a milk option.
              </li>
              <li>
                An interesting functionality of the dropdown is
                that I can minimize the dropdown menu by dragging the top
                halfway down my screen. Now, the menu only takes up the bottom
                half, as shown in my screenshots. Like the other mobile
                applications, I cannot highlight the text in the dropdown.
              </li>
              <li>
                I appreciate that the Starbucks website and mobile app have similar
                dropdown designs. This makes the platforms more efficient for users
                who switch between the website and the mobile app. This
                also makes both more learnable for those who have already used
                the other.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compared to EdStem and Apple Calendar,
                an accessibility flaw with the Starbucks' mobile dropdown
                is the similarity in motions to scroll and exit. While there is a small "X" button, 
                the more intuitive option for many users
                is to swipe down to close the menu. However,
                the swiping motion also scrolls in the dropdown. Different functionalities
                that require the same input limits accessibility for
                users with impaired motor control.

            to the user. I explored outputs including colors, text label,

                  On the EdStem website on Mac, the "Filter" dropdown

                  to the user that this "Filter" text is
                  clickable. Once the dropdown menu is open, when hovering over an
                  option, it turns blue, signalling that it can be
                  selected. Finally, once a filter is selected
                  and the menu closes, the dropdown button remains deep
                  blue to signal that the selected filter has been applied.

                  When I hover over the calendar dropdown button in Apple
                  Calendar, the color does not change. One way that this component
                  does use color is that each calendar is assigned a color, and
                  the button's color changes to the color of the calendar
                  selected. This color output increases
                  efficiency, because users learn what color calendar they
                  are looking for without needing to read the text in the
                  dropdown menu.

                  Hovering over the "Milk" dropdown button on the Starbucks
                  website on Mac, its color does not
                  change. When I click the button on
                  Mac and mobile, the button turns green. I don't find 
                  this color output useful,
                  since when you click the button, the dropdown menu also
                  appears, so you already know you've clicked the button. I
                  would find this green color more useful if it appeared on
                  hover, to signal that your mouse is in the right place to open
                  the menu.

                  labeled with the text "Filter" and a downward arrow.
                  However, after the user selects a filter from the dropdown,
                  the text label changes from "Filter" to the name of the filter
                  applied, such as "Unread", as in my screenshots. This is a
                  valuable piece of output for the user, because it reinforces
                  that they selected the filter that they meant to.

                  calendar currently selected for the event. Then, on mobile, when
                  the selected calendar changes, the button's text updates to
                  reflect the new calendar selected. This text output

                  Instead of a default, it
                  should start as “Not Selected”, and the user
                  shouldn't be able to buy the drink without selecting a milk.
                  An error output would prevent users from skipping
                  this dropdown and accidentally ordering the wrong milk.

                  Using the tab key, I can focus on the "Filter" dropdown button,

                  I have to use the up and down keys to
                  switch between options, and the tab key does nothing. I think
                  that the tab key doing nothing inside this menu
                  is a confusing output for someone who 
                  cannot see the screen. In addition to the up and down keys, 
                  I think the tab key should also work
                  to switch between these options.
                </td>
                <td>
                  As described in the inputs section, I can tab between calendar
                  events, and use the return key to open a
                  specific event. However, when I use the tab key inside this
                  window, the dropdown menu is never focused on. This sends 
                  confusing outputs/signals back to the user. If they cannot focus on
                  the dropdown menu, the application is signalling that it 
                  is disabled or not clickable, even though it is (and holds important functionality).
                </td>
                <td>
                  In the input section above, I found that I could focus on
                  Starbucks' dropdown using the tab key, but could not use 
                  the keyboard to open the dropdown menu. This prevents an
                  important output signal, which is that the user has selected
                  the right component to open the dropdown menu. Since the
                  return key does nothing, the user might be confused and think
                  that they have focused on the wrong component in their effort
                  to customize their milk selection.

                  On my Mac, I turned on VoiceOver and focused on the
                  "Filter" dropdown button. VoiceOver reads out
                  "Filter, menu pop up collapsed, button", which
                  informs the user of the name of this button and that this button
                  brings up a menu that is currently collapsed. When I opened the dropdown menu,
                  VoiceOver read out "menu, ..." followed by each of the
                  dropdown options. However, as I used the up and down keys to
                  move through options, VoiceOver did not read out their labels, 
                  it only did so when I hovered with my mouse.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Surprisingly, when I turned VoiceOver on, I was able
                  to use the tab key to focus on the calendar dropdown button. I
                  turned VoiceOver off again and confirmed that I couldn't without it. 
                  This impedes acccessibility, because not all impaired users use 
                  VoiceOver, or a screen reader at all. When I had the button focused with
                  VoiceOver, it read “Calendar, popover, sarah_ridley@brown.edu”, where “sarah_ridley@brown.edu” was the name of
                  the current calendar selected. However, I don't think that
                  “popover” is the clearest way to signal that this button opens
                  a dropdown menu.
                </td>
                <td>
                  When I focused on the "Milk"
                  dropdown button with VoiceOver on, it read “2% Milk, Milk,
                  menu pop up collapsed, button”. In comparison, Starbucks' explanation that this was a
                  collapsed pop up menu is clearer than Apple Calendar's “popover”. Then,
                  VoiceOver instructed me to press Control + Option + Space to
                  open the dropdown. I tried this keystroke again with VoiceOver
                  off, which did not work. Like Apple Calendar, Starbucks has created an
                  accessibility problem by mismatching the needs of those that do not use VoiceOver.

          <h2 id="redesign">III: State Models & Component Redesign</h2>
          <p>
            After exploring input and output from dropdowns on EdStem, Apple Calendar, and
            Starbucks, I had several ideas about how to improve the dropdown
            components found in all three applications. However, this case study
            will focus on my redesign of the calendar dropdown menu in Apple
            Calendar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before beginning my redesign, I created state models to display the
            current interactions with Apple Calendar's calendar
            dropdown menu. State models show both the available states of the
            component, as well as the actions that transition between states.
            Below, the two state models display pre-revision interactions
            with the touchpad and the keyboard respectively. Note that I
            often refer to pink highlights or borders, which is a Mac system
            setting that users customize, so these components are not pink for all users.
          </p>
          <h3>Initial Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Mouse User</h3>
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="public/initial-calendar-model-mouse.svg"
              alt="State model for pre-revision mouse interactions with calendar dropdown menu on Apple Calendar"
              width="60%"
            />
            <p class="left-pad">
              Given that this is the state model for mouse interactions, the
              user's mouse position and clicks cause all transitions between
              states. Another important note is that "Open" means that the
              dropdown menu has appeared. As shown in the state model, the
              dropdown menu stays visible even when the mouse leaves the area,
              but disappears if the mouse clicks outside of the dropdown menu
              area.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Initial Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Keyboard User</h3>
          <div class="image-box">
            <div>
              <p class="right-pad">
                As described in the input and output sections, without
                VoiceOver, I was unable to focus on the dropdown menu button
                with only my keyboard on Mac. So, this state model is
                missing a transition from inactive to focused, although it should
                be noted that the button can be tabbed into focus when VoiceOver
                is active.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the calendar dropdown menu button is focused, then users
                can press the return key, up and down arrows, and escape key
                to transition between states, as shown.
              </p>
            </div>
            <img

              width="60%"
            />
          </div>
          <p class="top-pad">
            As noted above, there are several areas of improvement for these state models.
            Below, I present two new state
            models for my revised calendar dropdown, with mouse
            and with keyboard. The main design change I made includes adding a
            "Confirm" button to the dropdown menu. I will
            explore and justify this choice alongside the Figma models further below.
          </p>
          <h3>Revised Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Mouse User</h3>
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="public/revised-calendar-model-mouse.svg"
              alt="State model for revised keyboard interactions with calendar dropdown menu on Apple Calendar"
              width="65%"
            />
            <p class="left-pad">
              As mentioned, the main revision I made was introducing a "Confirm"
              button on the dropdown menu. Now, after a user clicks one of the
              dropdown options, they also need to click the "Confirm" button to
              actually select their chosen option and close the dropdown menu.
              If they do not select "Confirm" after clicking an option, and
              instead click away, their selection will not be submitted.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Revised Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Keyboard User</h3>
          <div class="image-box">
            <div class="right-pad">
              <p>
                For keyboard interaction, I added a transition from disabled to focused
                with the tab key, which the initial state model lacked.
              </p>
              <p>
                As in the revised mouse model, this revised keyboard model also 
                introduces a "Confirm" button. Once the user has
                focused on an option with the up and down keys, when they press
                return, their focused option is selected. This also
                automatically focuses the "Confirm" button. So, the user
                needs to press the return key again to activate the "Confirm"

          <p>
            This Figma model is my redesign of the calendar dropdown menu in 
            Apple Calendar, which allows users to assign
            an event to a particular calendar. In the model above, this dropdown is 
            opened with the button with the blue square and the up/down arrows, located in the
            event editing window. The model contains three frames, described
            below:
          </p>
          <div class="col-box">
            <ul class="col-box-item">
              <li>
                The first Figma frame displays the initial state of my revised
                calendar dropdown menu. This is the state before the user has
                interacted with the dropdown, so the dropdown button is visible but the
                dropdown menu window has not been opened.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="col-box-item">
              <li>
                When the user opens the dropdown menu and hovers over (or focuses
                on) an option, they will see the second frame. Here, the
                dropdown menu is open and one of the options is highlighted.
                However, the user has not clicked on (or pressed the return key
                while focusing on) their selection yet.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="col-box-item">
              <li>
                This is a bonus state that is important to
                understanding my redesign. After the user clicks on (or presses
                return on) an option, that option turns dark gray, but is not yet submitted. Instead, as shown,
                the user still must press the "Confirm" button, which has automatically 
                been focused on, to submit their selection and close the dropdown menu.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            While not shown in the Figma models, the first way that my redesign increases accessibility is by 
            allowing users to focus on the dropdown with their keyboard but without
            VoiceOver. This interaction was 
            surprisingly missing in Apple Calendar.
            The only way that this change decreases efficiency is by adding one more
            component that keyboard users need to tab through as they explore
            the event editing window. However, this is an insignficant loss
            in efficiency that significantly increases accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in other ways, my revised component does increase accessibility at the expense of
            efficiency. Adding a "Confirm" button means that frequent users have
            one more click or key to press before they can submit their
            dropdown selection. However, this increases
            accessibility beacuse it means that users with impaired motor control
            are less likely to accidentally submit their selection. 
            This is because the extra confirmation
            transition allows users to accidentally select an option,
            but change their selection without the window closing (which is the
            current behavior of the component when any option is clicked).
          </p>
          <p>
            This change also improves learnability and memorability, because
            the "Confirm" button at the bottom of the dropdown signals to users
            that the things that have popped up on
            screen are all options to click and submit.
            They can also play around with clicking these options without the window
            closing every time. These lowered stakes help users get
            comfortable with the component faster.
          </p>
          <h2 id="reflection">IV: Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Exploring the usability of the dropdown menus in EdStem, Apple
            Calendar, and Starbucks led to many interesting observations, like how 
            all three applications used colors in slightly different ways
            to output state back to the user. This guided me to use
            colors strategically in my redesigned component,
            specifically when designing how a hovered option (Figma model 2) is
            highlighted in a different color than the selected option (Figma model 3).
          </p>
          <p>
            Comparing the accessibility of these three applications, the most
            accessible component was EdStem's dropdown menu, since it was the
            only one that I could fully navigate with the keyboard without
            turning on VoiceOver. So, keyboard navigability was an accessibility
            consideration missing from Apple Calendar and Starbucks, and in my
            revised Apple Calendar dropdown state model, I specified how the
            redesigned dropdown could be focused on and opened with the keyboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            When thinking about making components more accessible, it's useful
            to think in terms of mismatches, or situations where an
            interface creates unnecessary barriers for certain users due to a
            lack of inclusive thinking. In my redesign, adding keyboard
            navigability addresses the mismatch where users that only use the
            keyboard can still interact with this component. Similarly, adding
            the "Confirm" button addresses the mismatch where some users may
            accidentally press or interact with these components, and the
            confirmation step is more forgiving of accidental clicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this sense, the lack of keyboard accessibility on the Apple
            Calendar and Starbucks dropdowns negatively impacts users with
            visual impairments, since focusing on the dropdown was impossible
            without VoiceOver, which not all impaired users might use. On the
            other hand, the ARIA text read by VoiceOver is a feature that is beneficial to those
            with visual impairments, and across the three applications,
            Starbucks' components had the most clear and descriptive ARIA text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking more generally, it seems that the mouse is most often
            prioritized when designing components, as many designers are
            fully-abled, but this means that they may forget to consider
            the needs of those whose abilities are impaired.
