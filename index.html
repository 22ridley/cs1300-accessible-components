          <h1>Case Study: Rethinking the Dropdown Menu</h1>
          <p class="name">Sarah Ridley ● Brown University ● February 2025</p>
          <p>
            In this case study, I examined one UI component and considered
            alternative designs that could increase the component's
            accesibility, potentially at the risk of learnability, memorability,
            or efficiency. The UI component I chose is the dropdown component. I
            explored the accessibility of this component across devices and
            across modes of interacting with the device. In the sections below,
            I walk through the process I took in approaching this accessible
            redesign.
          </p>
          <h2 id="input">I: Input</h2>
          <p>
            This case study focuses on the dropdown menu UI component. I
            examined three different applications with dropdown menus, including
            the EdStem web application, the Appple Calendar web/mobile
            application, and the Starbucks web application/mobile app. For
            context, EdStem is a message board platform that facilitates
            student, TA, and professor interactions, that is commonly used at
            Brown. I first explored how different modes of input, including the
            mouse/touchpad, keyboard, and touch (on mobile) enabled different
            interactions with the dropdown menus in these three applications.
          </p>
          <h3>EdStem Web App</h3>
          <img src="public/edstem-screenshots.svg" />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The top screenshots show EdStem's 'filter' dropdown menu for
                filtering EdStem posts on the desktop web application.
                Interacting with this component with my mouse, when I hover over
                the filter button, the button turns from gray to blue. Once I
                click on the button, the dropdown menu appears below the filter
                button. No matter where I move my mouse on the screen, the
                dropdown menu stays visible. When I click anywhere other than
                the dropdown menu, the menu disappears.
              </li>
              <li>
                If instead I hover over the options while the dropdown menu is
                visible, each individual option turns blue on hover. Then, if I
                click on one of the options in the dropdown menu, the menu also
                disappears, but also changes the selected filter. However, with
                my mouse, I cannot select the text in any of the options in the
                dropdown menu. So, I cannot copy and paste this text elsewhere.
              </li>
              <li>
                One element of using the dropdown with my mouse that is
                learnable is that the dropdown menu has a small down arrow on
                it. This is learnable because if I was using this UI for the
                first time, the down arrow is a good affordance for me to
                realize that I should try clicking on it, and something (the
                dropdown options) will appear below. Something efficient is the
                order that the dropdown options appear in, since this order
                never changes, so users can get a muscle-memory about how far to
                move their mouse in case they frequently need to filter for only
                'unread' messages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Specifically considering mouse/touchpad interactions, the
                accessibility of EdStem's dropdown menu is pretty comparable to
                that of Apple Calendar and Starbucks. One feature that stood out
                about EdStem's filter button using the mouse was that the filter
                button turns blue on hover, whereas neither Apple Calendar or
                Starbucks change color on hover. This makes it easier for
                someone using the mouse to see that they are in range to click
                the button they want to press, in case they are trying to use
                filter but have some difficulties discerning which components
                are buttons.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Keyboard</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To use the dropdown menu with the keyboard only, I had to press
                the tab button many times until the filter button was selected.
                Once this button was selected, then I had to press the return
                key, which opened the dropdown menu. Then, I could use the up
                and down arrows to change which option was highlighted. Then,
                when I pressed return, the highlighted option was inputted.
              </li>
              <li>
                One thing I can't do with my keyboard is select the text in the
                dropdown menu (which I also couldn't do with my keyboard). I
                tried to use the Command + A shortcut to select the text, but it
                selected all the other text on the page except the text in the
                dropdown menu. One thing that I could do with my keyboard was
                close the dropdown menu without selecting anything by using the
                escape key.
              </li>
              <li>
                Something memorable about this component is that its pretty
                intuitive that you can use the up and down arrows to navigate
                once you've hit return on the filter button. While I think this
                is memorable, I don't think its very learnable. You use the tab
                key to select the filter button, but then have to use the up and
                down keys once you're in the dropdown. To me, it would me easier
                to pick up if you always used the tab key to switch to highlight
                different things, and the return key to make your ultimate
                selection.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compared to Apple Calendar and Starbucks, I found that EdStem
                did better in terms of accessibility. As described below, both
                Apple Calendar and Starbucks were more confusing and difficult
                to use simply with my keyboard, which is often how people with
                physical disabilities interact with websites, instead of with
                the mouse/touchpad.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Touch (Mobile)</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The bottom screenshots above show my interactions with the
                filter dropdown menu on the EdStem website from a mobile device.
                On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the bottom of my
                screen, and covers the rest of the screen. From there, you can
                click on of the filters, which closes the dropdown, or click
                Cancel, which closes the dropdown without filtering.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similarly to the mouse and keyboard, I cannot highlight the text
                in the dropdown on my phone. When I try to press and hold on the
                text, nothing happens, and when I release, the dropdown menu
                select whichever filter whose text I was trying to highlight.
                One thing this component can do is scroll. Specifically, if
                there are too many filter options to fit the screen height, I
                can scroll to see more options below.
              </li>
              <li>
                One thing that is efficient about this dropdown is that someone
                only needs to quick taps to select the filter they want, and
                they can memorize the positions of these clicks if they use
                filter posts on EdStem frequently. One thing that's not very
                learnable about this dropdown menu is that when the dropdown is
                opened, it fills the entire screen. This means that someone who
                accidentally hits the filter button that opens the dropdown will
                have no idea what button they accidentally pressed when first
                using the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, this makes the EdStem mobile dropdown more accessible
                in some ways than the Apple Calendar or Starbucks. Filling the
                entire screen does make each option bigger, which is more
                accessible to people who struggle with fine motor controls.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h3>Calendar Mac App/Mobile App</h3>
          <img src="public/calendar-screenshots.svg" />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The left screenshots show Apple Calendar's dropdown menu for
                choosing a calendar to assign an event on the desktop web
                application. Interacting with this component with my mouse, when
                I hover over the button that opens the dropdown, the button does
                not change. Once I click on the button, the dropdown menu
                appears on top of the button. Wherever I move my mouse on the
                screen, the dropdown menu stays visible. When I click anywhere
                other than the dropdown menu, the menu disappears.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the dropdown menu is visible, if I hover over the options,
                each individual option turns pink on hover. This pink is a
                setting that I chose myself. Then, if I click on one of the
                options in the dropdown menu, the menu also disappears, but also
                changes the selected calendar. With my mouse, I cannot select
                the text in any of the options in the dropdown menu. Like for
                EdStem, I cannot copy and paste this text to somewhere else.
              </li>
              <li>
                One element of using the dropdown with my mouse that is not as
                learnable as it could be is that the dropdown menu has an up
                arrow and a down arrow on the button that opens it. I don't
                think this is very learnable because for a dropdown, I would
                expect just a down arrow. There is also no text on this button
                that says anything about choosing a calendar. However, this is
                efficient from a space perspective. And, as users get
                comfortable with Apple Calendar, they already know what the
                button does and can find it quickly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using the touchpad, the accessibility of Apple Calendar's
                dropdown menu has a lot in common with EdStem and Starbucks.
                But, unlike EdStem's filter button, hovering over the dropdown
                menu button does not make it change colors. I think that making
                it change colors on hover would be more accessible, since it's
                easier for someone to know that this is a button that is
                clickable. On the other hand, one thing that makes the Apple
                Calendar dropdown menu uniquely accessible is that the text
                color changes when I hover on one of the dropdown option. This
                is because the background color changes to pink, so the text
                changes to white to ensure contrast for those with visual
                impairments.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Keyboard</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Using only the keyboard to navigate this dropdown menu on Apple
                Calendar was pretty difficult (if not impossible). I could use
                the tab key to select different calendar events, then I pressed
                enter to open the editing mode for that calendar event. However,
                as I tabbed through the options on this menu, the dropdown menu
                button was never highlighted. So, I was unsuccessful in using
                only the keyboard. However, once I clicked the dropdown, I was
                able to use the up and down arrow keys to switch between
                selections.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similar to the EdStem dropdown, I couldn't select the text in
                the dropdown menu. When I pressed Command + A when I had the
                dropdown open, nothing happened. When I pressed Command C, it
                closed the dropdown menu. Then, I pasted in a text file to see
                if it had copied anything, and it copied all the information
                about the calendar event, not just the dropdown calendar
                information.
              </li>
              <li>
                I found it frustrating that I couldn't navigate into the
                calendar dropdown with my keyboard only. This really hurts
                learnability, particularly because the action can't be done in
                the first place. Of course, this also impedes memorability and
                efficiency.
              </li>
              <li>
                Not only does not being able to be navigable with the keyboard
                impede usability, it also of course is very inaccessible. This
                is a clear instance of a mismatch, as this is a dropdown that
                can only be used with the touchpad, and as far as I could find,
                could not be opened with my keyboard only. Those with physical
                impairments therefore likely struggle to change the calendar
                that their events are assigned to.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Touch (Mobile)</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The right screenshots above show my interactions with the
                calendar dropdown menu on the Apple Calendar app from a mobile
                device. On my phone, the dropdown menu pulls up and covers the
                right half of my screen. I can scroll when the options overflow,
                click to the left to leave the dropdown, or select one of the
                options.
              </li>
              <li>
                Again, I cannot highlight the text in the dropdown on my phone.
                When I try to press and hold on the text, nothing happens, and
                when I release, the dropdown menu select whichever calendar
                whose text I was trying to highlight. One thing this component
                can do is scroll. When I try to drag the text, nothing happens.
                This limits the functionality to only selecting one of the
                calendars.
              </li>
              <li>
                One thing that makes the mobile dropdown more learnable than the
                desktop dropdown is that the name of the current calendar is
                part of the button to open the dropdown menu. This makes it more
                learnable and memorable because someone using the app for the
                first time, or the first time in a while, will more quickly
                understand that the dropdown will let them choose a different
                calendar for this event if they want to.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compared to the EdStem and Starbucks mobile dropdowns, I think
                that the Apple Calendar one is slightly less accessible. Unlike
                the others, it does not fill the entire screen by default. This
                makes it easier to accidentally click out of the dropdown. For
                the EdStem and Starbucks mobile dropdowns, you can only close
                them with an explicit Cancel or X button. Although, if you open
                this dropdown by accident, this makes the Apple Calendar
                dropdown more accessible since it is easier to close. So, it
                really depends on the user's goals.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h3>Starbucks Web App/Mobile App</h3>
          <img src="public/starbucks-screenshots.svg" />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The left screenshots show my interactions with Starbucks' web
                application, specifically with the dropdown for choosing a milk
                or milk alternative. Using my mouse, when I hover over the
                button that opens the dropdown, the button does not change. But,
                once I click on the button, it turns green, and the dropdown
                menu appears on top of the button. Wherever I move my mouse on
                the screen, the dropdown menu stays visible. When I click
                anywhere other than the dropdown menu, the menu disappears.
              </li>
              <li>
                With the dropdown menu open, if I hover over the milk options,
                each option turns pink. Like with the calendar app, this pink is
                a setting that I chose. Then, if I click on one of the options
                in the dropdown menu, the menu disappears and changes the
                selected milk. With my mouse, I cannot select the text in any of
                the options in the dropdown menu. Visually, this appears to be
                Apple's built-in dropdown menu, so it functions very similarly
                to the Apple Calendar dropdowns on my Mac.
              </li>
              <li>
                One thing that makes using this dropdown with my mouse pretty
                learnable is that the dropdown menu is labeled with 'Milk' and
                has a down arrow on the button to open the dropdown. This is a
                very clear affordance of where to click, and I appreciate this
                consideration for learnability and memorability. One thing that
                could make enhance efficiency for this component would be if
                repeat customers could have a favorites section at the top of
                the this dropdown where they could save the milk that they
                always get, since many customers have strong milk preferences.

                Regarding mouse/touchpad interactions, the accessibility of
                Apple Calendar's dropdown menu is similar to EdStem and
                Starbucks. But, unlike EdStem's filter button, hovering over the
                dropdown menu button does not make it change colors. I think
                that making it change colors on hover would be more accessible,
                since it's easier for someone to know that this is a button that
                is clickable. On the other hand, one thing that makes the Apple
                Calendar dropdown menu uniquely accessible is that the text
                color changes when I hover on one of the dropdown option. This
                is because the background color changes to pink, so the text
                changes to white to ensure contrast for those with visual
                impairments.

                Disappointingly, I struggled to use my keyboard to navigate this
                component on the Starbucks website. I was able to use the tab
                key to focus on the button to open the dropdown. However, when I
                pressed the return key, nothing happened, and the dropdown menu
                did not open. I tried several other buttons, but they either did
                nothing or focused on the next element on the page. When I
                clicked the button to open the dropdown menu, I was able to use
                my up and down keys to navigate the options.
              </li>
              <li>
                Like the EdStem and Apple Calendar dropdowns, I couldn't select
                the text in the dropdown. I tried Command + A, but this closed
                the dropdown menu and highlighted all the other text on the
                page. Also, nothing happened when I tried to drag and drop the
                text from the dropdown elsewhere, except for closing the
                dropdown.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similarly to Apple Calendars, I was disappointed that I failed
                to navigate into the milk dropdown with my keyboard. Again, this
                blocks the learnability, memorability, and efficiency of this
                feature.

                These problems discussed particularly apply to those with
                physical disabilities who are the most likley to only use a
                keyboard or a similar device to navigate their screen. These
                dropdowns that are completely unusable without a mouse create a
                mismatch that prevent many users from being able to participate
                in these products.

                The right screenshots above show my interactions with the
                calendar dropdown menu on the Starbucks app from a mobile
                device. On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the bottom
                and covers almost the entire screen. I can scroll when the
                options overflow, click to the X to leave the dropdown, or
                select one of the options.
              </li>
              <li>
                One other interesting functionality that this dropdown has is
                that I can minimize the dropdown menu by dragging the top
                halfway down my screen. Now, the menu only takes up the bottom
                half, as shown in my screenshots. Like the other mobile
                applications, I cannot highlight the text in the dropdown.
              </li>
              <li>
                Something I appreciate about the Starbucks apps I have looked at
                is that the website and the mobile app have very similar
                dropdown designs. This makes the apps more efficient for users
                who might switch between the website and the mobile app. This
                also makes one more learnable for those who have already used
                the other.
              </li>
              <li>
                In relation to the EdStem and Apple Calendar mobile dropdowns,
                one thing that makes the Starbucks mobile dropdown less
                accessible is that the motions to scroll and exit the dropdown
                are very similar. While there is an X button to leave the
                dropdown menu, it's pretty small, so the more intuitive option
                for some users might be to swipe down out of the menu. However,
                since there are so many milks, scrolling also reveals more milk
                options in the dropdowns. Having two different functionalities
                require the same input limits accessibility, particularly for
                users with poor motor control.

            After exploring inputs, I also explored outputs from the dropdown
            menus on these three applications. The inputs can change the state
            of a dropdown component, and the output reflects these state changes
            to the user. So, I explored outputs including button colors, text
            label, focus order, and screen reader output.

            One interesting thing I learned from this case study was the vast
            variety of ways that such a simple component as a dropdown menu can
            be designed.
